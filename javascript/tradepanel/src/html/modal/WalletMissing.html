You need to set up a wallet in your browser before you can use liminal.market.
<br/><br/>
To make it simple, we would like to suggest two options. In your browser or your phone.
<ul>
    <li>For the browser we recommend <a href="https://metamask.io/download/"
                                                                         target="_blank">Metamask</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        For your phone, we like <a href="https://www.tokenpocket.pro/en/download/app" target="_blank">Token Poket</a>
    </li>
</ul>
<br/>
But, you have <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/" target="_blank">many options</a> if you want to learn more.
