# OrderSide.ts

## Overview

The `OrderSide.ts` file is a TypeScript code file that exports an enumeration called `OrderSide`. This enumeration represents the two possible sides of an order in a trading system: buy and sell. The `OrderSide` enumeration can be used in various parts of a trading application to ensure that only valid order sides are used.

## Usage

To use the `OrderSide` enumeration in your TypeScript code, you can import it and then use it as a type for variables or function parameters. Here are some examples of how to use the `OrderSide` enumeration:

### Example 1: Importing and using the OrderSide enumeration

```typescript
import { OrderSide } from './OrderSide';

const orderSide: OrderSide = OrderSide.buy;
```

### Example 2: Using the OrderSide enumeration in a function

```typescript
import { OrderSide } from './OrderSide';

function placeOrder(side: OrderSide, quantity: number, price: number) {
    // Implementation of the placeOrder function
}

placeOrder(OrderSide.sell, 100, 50);
```

## Enumeration Members

The `OrderSide` enumeration has two members:

### 1. buy

The `buy` member represents a buy order. It has a string value of `'buy'`.

### 2. sell

The `sell` member represents a sell order. It has a string value of `'sell'`.

## Technical Concepts

The `OrderSide` enumeration is a standard TypeScript enumeration. Enumerations in TypeScript are a way to define a set of named constants, which can be used to document the intent of the code and improve readability. Enumerations can be used as types for variables or function parameters, ensuring that only valid values are used.

In this case, the `OrderSide` enumeration is used to represent the two possible sides of an order in a trading system, making it clear which side of the trade is being referred to and preventing the use of invalid values.

## File Content

The content of the `OrderSide.ts` file is as follows:

```typescript
export enum OrderSide {
    buy = 'buy',
    sell = 'sell'
}
```
