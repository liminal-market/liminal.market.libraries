# KycStatus.ts

KycStatus.ts is a TypeScript code file that defines an interface called `KycStatus`. This interface is used to represent the Know Your Customer (KYC) status of a user in a financial application. The KYC process is a standard practice in the finance industry to verify the identity of clients and assess their suitability for financial services.

## Interface: KycStatus

The `KycStatus` interface consists of the following properties:

- `isValidKyc`: A boolean value that indicates whether the user has a valid KYC status.
- `brokerId`: A string representing the unique identifier of the broker responsible for the user's account.
- `status`: A string representing the current status of the user's KYC process (e.g., "pending", "approved", "rejected").
- `hasBuyingPower`: A boolean value that indicates whether the user has the ability to make purchases in the financial application.
- `message`: A string containing any additional information or messages related to the user's KYC status.

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the `KycStatus` interface in a TypeScript file:

```typescript
import KycStatus from './KycStatus';

const userKycStatus: KycStatus = {
  isValidKyc: true,
  brokerId: '12345',
  status: 'approved',
  hasBuyingPower: true,
  message: 'KYC verified successfully',
};

function displayKycStatus(kycStatus: KycStatus) {
  console.log(`User KYC status: ${kycStatus.status}`);
  console.log(`Broker ID: ${kycStatus.brokerId}`);
  console.log(`Has buying power: ${kycStatus.hasBuyingPower}`);
  console.log(`Message: ${kycStatus.message}`);
}

displayKycStatus(userKycStatus);
```

In this example, we import the `KycStatus` interface and create a `userKycStatus` object that implements the interface. We then define a `displayKycStatus` function that takes a `KycStatus` object as a parameter and logs its properties to the console.

## Conclusion

The KycStatus.ts file provides a simple and clear interface for representing the KYC status of a user in a financial application. By using this interface, developers can easily manage and display the KYC information of their users, ensuring compliance with industry standards and regulations.
