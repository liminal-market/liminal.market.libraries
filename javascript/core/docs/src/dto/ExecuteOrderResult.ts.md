# ExecuteOrderResult.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines an interface called `ExecuteOrderResult`. The interface is used to represent the result of an order execution operation. It contains three properties: `success`, `message`, and `order`. This documentation will provide a detailed description of the interface, its properties, and examples of how to use it.

## Interface Description

The `ExecuteOrderResult` interface is designed to standardize the structure of the response object returned by a function or method that executes an order. It contains the following properties:

- `success`: A boolean value indicating whether the order execution was successful or not.
- `message`: A string value providing additional information about the result of the order execution. This can be an error message or a success message, depending on the value of the `success` property.
- `order`: An instance of the `OrderDto` class, which represents the order that was executed.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the `ExecuteOrderResult` interface in your code:

### Example 1: Creating an instance of ExecuteOrderResult

```typescript
import ExecuteOrderResult from "./ExecuteOrderResult";
import OrderDto from "./OrderDto";

const order: OrderDto = {
  // ... order properties ...
};

const executeOrderResult: ExecuteOrderResult = {
  success: true,
  message: "Order executed successfully",
  order: order,
};
```

### Example 2: Using ExecuteOrderResult in a function

```typescript
import ExecuteOrderResult from "./ExecuteOrderResult";
import OrderDto from "./OrderDto";

function executeOrder(order: OrderDto): ExecuteOrderResult {
  // ... perform order execution logic ...

  if (/* order execution is successful */) {
    return {
      success: true,
      message: "Order executed successfully",
      order: order,
    };
  } else {
    return {
      success: false,
      message: "Order execution failed",
      order: order,
    };
  }
}
```

## Technical Concepts

### TypeScript Interfaces

In TypeScript, interfaces are used to define the structure of an object. They can be used to enforce a specific shape for an object, ensuring that it contains the required properties with the correct types. In this code file, the `ExecuteOrderResult` interface is used to define the structure of the response object returned by an order execution function or method.

### OrderDto

The `OrderDto` class is imported from another file and is used as the type for the `order` property in the `ExecuteOrderResult` interface. This class represents an order and should contain all the necessary properties and methods related to an order.
