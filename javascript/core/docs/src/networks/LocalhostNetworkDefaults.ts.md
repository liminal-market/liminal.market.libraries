# LocalhostNetworkDefaults.ts

This TypeScript file defines the `LocalhostNetworkDefaults` class, which is an abstract class that extends the `TestNetwork` class. The purpose of this class is to provide default configurations for a localhost test network, such as chain ID, name, native currency, and RPC URL.

## Class Description

The `LocalhostNetworkDefaults` class is an abstract class that inherits from the `TestNetwork` class. It provides default configurations for a localhost test network, such as chain ID, name, native currency, and RPC URL. This class is useful when setting up a local test environment for Ethereum-based applications.

## Examples

To use the `LocalhostNetworkDefaults` class, you would typically extend it in your own class:

```typescript
import LocalhostNetworkDefaults from "./LocalhostNetworkDefaults";

class MyLocalhostNetwork extends LocalhostNetworkDefaults {
  // Your custom implementation here
}
```

## Methods

### constructor

The `constructor` method is a protected method that initializes the `LocalhostNetworkDefaults` class with default values for the localhost test network.

#### Parameters

_None_

## Properties

### ChainId

The `ChainId` property is a static property that represents the default chain ID for the localhost test network. The default value is `31337`.

### RpcUrl

The `RpcUrl` property is a static property that represents the default RPC URL for the localhost test network. The default value is `'http://127.0.0.1:8545/'`.

## Technical Concepts

- **Abstract Class**: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from. In this case, `LocalhostNetworkDefaults` is an abstract class that extends the `TestNetwork` class.
- **localhost**: In the context of this file, localhost refers to a local test environment for Ethereum-based applications. It is a network that runs on the user's own computer, allowing developers to test their applications without connecting to a public network.
- **RPC URL**: The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) URL is the address used to communicate with the Ethereum node. In this case, the default RPC URL is set to `'http://127.0.0.1:8545/'`, which points to a local Ethereum node running on the user's computer.
