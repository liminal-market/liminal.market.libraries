# NetworkType.ts

This is a TypeScript code file that defines a `NetworkType` class. The class is responsible for managing different network types and providing instances of the appropriate network based on the provided chain ID.

## Imported Modules

The following modules are imported in the `NetworkType.ts` file:

- `Network`: A base class for different network types.
- `LocalhostNetwork`: A class representing the localhost network.
- `MumbaiNetwork`: A class representing the Mumbai network.

## NetworkType Class

The `NetworkType` class is responsible for managing different network types and providing instances of the appropriate network based on the provided chain ID.

### Properties

- `Networks`: A static property that holds an array of available network types. Currently, it includes `LocalhostNetwork` and `MumbaiNetwork`.

### Methods

#### getInstance

The `getInstance` method is a static method that takes a `chainId` as a parameter and returns an instance of the appropriate network type based on the provided chain ID.

- Parameters:
  - `chainId`: The chain ID for which the network instance is required.

- Returns: An instance of the appropriate `Network` type based on the provided chain ID, or `undefined` if no matching network type is found.

## Examples

Here's an example of how to use the `NetworkType` class to get an instance of a network based on a chain ID:

```typescript
import NetworkType from "./NetworkType";

const chainId = 80001; // Mumbai network chain ID
const networkInstance = NetworkType.getInstance(chainId);

if (networkInstance) {
  console.log(`Network instance: ${networkInstance}`);
} else {
  console.log("No matching network found for the provided chain ID.");
}
```

In this example, the `NetworkType.getInstance()` method is called with the Mumbai network's chain ID (80001). The method returns an instance of the `MumbaiNetwork` class, which is then logged to the console. If no matching network type is found for the provided chain ID, the console will display a message indicating that no matching network was found.
