## Overview

The `TestNetwork` class is an abstract class that inherits from the `Network` class. It is designed to be extended by other classes that represent specific test networks. The class sets the `ServerUrl` property to a predefined test network URL and sets the `TestNetwork` flag to `true`.

## Usage

To use the `TestNetwork` class, you need to create a new class that extends it. Here's an example:

```typescript
import TestNetwork from "./TestNetwork";

class MyTestNetwork extends TestNetwork {
  // Add custom implementation here
}

const myTestNetwork = new MyTestNetwork();
```

## Methods

### constructor

The `constructor` method is a protected method that initializes the `TestNetwork` class. It sets the `ServerUrl` property to the test network URL and the `TestNetwork` flag to `true`.

#### Parameters

There are no parameters for this method.

## Technical Concepts

- **Abstract Class**: An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it is meant to be extended by other classes. In this case, the `TestNetwork` class is an abstract class that should be extended by other classes representing specific test networks.
- **Inheritance**: The `TestNetwork` class extends the `Network` class, which means it inherits all the properties and methods of the `Network` class. This allows the `TestNetwork` class to reuse the functionality provided by the `Network` class while adding or modifying specific behavior for test networks.
